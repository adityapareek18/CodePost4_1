# CodePost
A platform to encourage knowledge sharing in a workplace.

CodePost is intended to be a platform for a workplace where knowledge transfer is taken seriously. It makes the process of knowledge sharing meaningful by acting as an efficient end point for all team members to hop on.

Tech Stack:
<br /><br />
I've used MEAN stack here to get hands-on with this exciting framework.
<br /><br />
M - MongoDB (Atlas implementation which is cloud based DB.)
<br />
E - Express (Middleware)
<br />
A - Angular6 (Frontend Framework)
<br />
N - NodeJS (Backend)


Features(WIP):
<br /><br />
Real time chat between team members.
Video Conferencing to deliver KT sessions online.

I've not been very active on this because of some other reservations but there's a timeline in place per feature. Happy to get contributions from people wanting to learn by working.
